# TreeLayout

TreeLayout, elegant and easy to use, strong maintainability and scalability.

## Introduction

TreeLayout supports both horizontal and vertical orientations and can be nested as well. 

It enables dynamic insertion, deletion, and refreshing operations for child nodes using protocols and generics in Swift. It supports local operations and whether to include animation effects. 

As long as the protocol is adhered to, child nodes can be of any type, including but not limited to UIView, CALayer, Struct, Enum, and more. In other words, child nodes can accommodate any content, even serving as placeholders for spacing purposes.
